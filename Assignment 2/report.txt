                 ---------ANALYSIS OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN A SET OF PREDICTIVELY CO-EXPRESSED GENES----------
                 ---------------------PERFORMED BY: Alicia Portela Est√©vez----------------------

INTRODUCTION
A recent paper (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0108567) executes a meta-analysis of a few thousand published co-expressed gene sets from Arabidopsis thaliana. They break these co-expression sets into ~20 sub-networks of <200 genes each, that they find consistently co-expressed with one another. One of this sub-networks has 168 predictively co-expressed genes

OBJECTIVE
The objective of this further analysis is testing if there is already information that links those 168 genes into known regulatory networks, either in a direct or indirect way, and annotate members of each network with any possible KEGG Pathway or GO Terms.

MATERIAL & METHODS
Materials used in this analysis are:
1. The sub-network with 168 predicted co-expressed genes.
2. BAR database from University of Toronto, in order to search for interactions, either direct or indirect, between the 168 co-expressed genes, through PSICQUIC REST API.
3. UniProt database, in order to search for KEGG and GO annotations, through TOGO REST API.

Methods followed in this analysis are:
1. Type of interactions
In this analysis, 2 kind of interactions have been analysed:
-Direct interactions: A-B, in which A and B are genes that belong to the co-expressed sub-network.
-Indirect interactions: A-B-C, in which A and C are genes that belong to the co-expressed sub-network, but not B, which is the intermediary.
2. Criteria for searching for interactions
In this analysis, 2 criteria have been followed:
-Interactors must belong to Arabidopsis thaliana species. It has been achieved by filtering by a regex, corresponding to the AGI locus code.
-MIscore > 0.485, as mentioned in the article with DOI: 10.1093/database/bau131.

RESULTS
In total, 58 networks have been found
Below, it is shown one by one the networks, with the following information:
1. Number of network
2. Type of interaction: direct/indirect
3. Members of the network
4. KEGG annotations: KEGG ID and KEGG pathway
5. GO annotations: GO ID and GO terms

DISCUSSION
Given a sub-network of predictively co-expressed 168 number of genes by the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0108567, the goal of this further analysis has been checking if there is already available information in databases about direct or indirect interactions between those genes, and thus, creating sub-networks of interaction. Also, each network has been annotated with possible KEGG pathways and GO terms of its members.
This analysis has been able to find 58 networks, most of them as a result of indirect interactions between members of the sub-network list, with only one intermediary. Thus, maximum interaction depth developed in this analysis is 2. That is to say, direct interactions include 2 members of the sub-network list (A-B), whereas indirect interactions take into account 2 members of the sub-network list (A-C), which interact through only one intermediary (B).
Although this analysis has performed well, further studies may do deeper interaction analyses in the future, with more intermediaries, that will lead to create greater networks.
